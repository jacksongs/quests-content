The fifth most-funded journalism campaign on Pozible isn't really journalism, but the success of the Labor Herald supports the value of crowdfunding within publishing.

The 600-plus backers of the Labor Herald on crowdfunding site Pozible include Labor staff and KPMG Partner and former union leader Paul Howes.

And the campaign introduced crowdfunding to a large number of first time backers. Around seven in eight supporters had never pledged on Pozible before.

Howes and other Labor supporters pledged around $40,000 for the campaign for the new website which [describes itself](https://www.laborherald.com.au/faq/) as "your openly biased news service":

>We will bring you fresh ideas, news and information from an Australian Labor Party perspective. We don’t pretend to be an online newspaper or traditional press outlet – after all, the press gallery has refused us a press pass. Just think of us as your openly biased news service.

Only four other Australian projects on Pozible have raised more investment within the ["journalism" category](http://www.pozible.com/list/mot/11/au/0).

These projects are:
* the New Matilda Relaunch - raising $175,838,
* the Protect The Star Observer campaign - $103,938,
* Lost Perth - The Book - $71,280, and 
* Dan Ilic's A Rational Fear - $52,825.

According to an analysis of supporters of these five projects, 87 per cent of Labor Herald backers have not pledged to any other Pozible projects. Only the Perth project had a higher proportion of sole-supporters.



The [Labor Herald editorial guidelines state](https://www.laborherald.com.au/editorial-guidelines/):

> The Labor Herald puts our users first in order to build an audience which will share and distribute content, ideas and discussion on behalf of the Australian Labor Party.

In 2013-14, [the Labor Party reported receiving around $40 million in donations](http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Returns/55/SLDJ8.pdf). KPMG, Paul Howes' current employer, donated $27,500.

Crowdfunding campaigns are often pursued for reasons other than fund-raising, according to [a paper released last year by two American researchers](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2376997):

>One theme running through our results is that crowdfunding is not just about the money received from backers – successful projects also receive other benefits. We asked our sample about why they chose to seek crowdfunding. Among successful projects, the most agreed-upon reason was “To see if there was demand for the project,” followed by “As a way of marketing my project,” and “To connect directly with a community of my fans or supporters.” The answer “The project could not have been funded without raising the goal” was actually the 4th most popular answer, at 54% of respondents agreeing. 

The [Labor Herald](https://www.laborherald.com.au/) [was refused membership to the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery](http://www.crikey.com.au/2015/07/22/labor-herald-rejected-from-the-press-gallery/), according to Crikey media reporter Myriam Robin this week.
